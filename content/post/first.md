## It's the dawn of a new era!

After trying and failing to keep a Ghost blog up and running, I've had enough.  I'm throwing in the towel, admitting defeat, and joining the legions of static-site-generators out there.  Welcome to my new Hugo blog.  Expect the same level of content as before, with much less downtime!

While I'll miss the experience of writing in Ghost's lovely editor, here's a list of things I won't miss:

- nodejs falling over
- mysterious syslog entries
- Cloudflare's 502 page
- having a "login" and a "password" for a blog

It's good to be back, World.
