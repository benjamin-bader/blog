My name is [Ben Bader](https://linkedin.com/in/bendb).  I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/benjamin-bader), amateur pianist, and transplated Midwesterner.  I work in San Francisco, on a Macbook, writing Android apps, for Microsoft - **this blog and its opinions are mine alone**.  I like to write about programming, startups, and side-projects.

## Background

I was Android Lead at [KeepSafe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kii.safe), a mobile-privacy startup in San Francisco, for a few years.  Before that I worked at [Rdio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rdio), [Square](https://squareup.com), and a number of other startups for a few more years, doing a bit of just about everything.

In a past life I was a classical musician, and although I still spend my working days at a keyboard, I mainly play the radio now.

## Open-Source Projects

* [Thrifty](https://github.com/Microsoft/thrifty) - a complete Thrift compiler and runtime for Android - "Wire for Thrift"
* [dexcount-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/KeepSafe/dexcount-gradle-plugin) - a Gradle plugin for Android apps that keeps tabs on how close your app is to the 65K method limit
* [Stiletto (deprecated)](http://stiletto.bendb.com) - A compile-time dependency injection library targeting Xamarin, and the only sophisticated IoC container to function on MonoTouch
